## Introduction

* The methodology section should be a separate chapter
* You should describe the pros and cons of primary and secondary data in more detail

## Chapter 01

* Good mention of the issue of underreporting. Will you do something about it or are you just mentioning it? You should also mention the idea of "lower bound".
* Section 1.2 is clear and well written.

## Chapter 02

* Good overview of criminological theories. If you are favouring one theory over the other, you should mention it here.
